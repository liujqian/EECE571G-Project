## Acknowledgement
We acknowledge that we have used the code provided by Dr. Zehua Wang in his lectures as 
a base when writting the code for this project. More specifically, we referred to his 
React.js and Web3.js tutorial (<https://github.com/comey/react-new>) when implementing the front-end.
Most of the code used to interact with the backend smart contract are based on his examples
given here: <https://github.com/comey/react-new/blob/main/src/util/interact.js>. 

We used Foundry as the library for testing and deploying smart contracts and we followed the tutorial 
given here: <https://github.com/comey/foundry-demo> by Dr. Zehua Wang when using Foundry.
